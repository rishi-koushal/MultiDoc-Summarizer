When the air is dirty it has become polluted. Air pollution is made up of gases, dust, odors, particles, smoke, fumes, and other substances which can be harmful to humans, animals, plants, and all living organisms. The air is contaminated and unclean.
Air pollution affects the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere of the Earth is like a blanket of air which protects all life. Without the atmosphere, life would not exist. The atmosphere protects living organisms from the heat of the Sun during the day, and at night it prevents the warm air from escaping. Basically, the atmosphere helps keep the living things on Earth from burning up or freezing.The pollution in the air, though, may affect this 'blanket' and becomes harmful to life on Earth.
