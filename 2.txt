A primary pollutant is one that is directly released into the air causing pollution. An example is carbon monoxide, which comes from cars and trucks on the road. A second primary pollutant is sulfur dioxide, which comes from the burning of coal. A secondary pollutant is a substance or substances mix together in the air due to a chemical reaction. When these substances mix together, the air pollution is much more dangerous and harmful to organisms. An example is a photochemical smog. It is difficult to avoid the pollution in the air since it is the place where people get the oxygen to breathe and live. Pollution can travel with the wind from one place to another and spread over a large number of miles.
