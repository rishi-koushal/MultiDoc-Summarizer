Air pollution affects the Earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere of the Earth is like a blanket of air which protects all life. Without the atmosphere, life would not exist. An example is carbon monoxide, which comes from cars and trucks on the road. A second primary pollutant is sulfur dioxide, which comes from the burning of coal. A secondary pollutant is a substance or substances mix together in the air due to a chemical reaction. An example is a photochemical smog. The three main causes of pollution by humans includes the release of smoke and fumes from manufacturing plants and various industries. This type of pollution occurs often because people rely on transportation every day.
