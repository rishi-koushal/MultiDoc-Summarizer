The three main causes of pollution by humans includes the release of smoke and fumes from manufacturing plants and various industries. Power plants release carbon monoxide and furnaces that burn waste are two examples of manmade pollution. Gasoline refineries also release dangerous chemicals in the air called hydrocarbons. The second cause is the burning of fossil fuels such as from cars, trucks, trains, airplanes. This type of pollution occurs often because people rely on transportation every day. Another main cause of pollution is from household and farming chemicals. There are several effects of air pollution including acid rain, which is when rain is mixed with the pollution in the air. It can cause problems with breathing and irritation to the eyes, nose, or throat. Sometimes people can also get headaches or have allergic reactions. Long-term effects can include lung cancer, heart disease and other health problems.
